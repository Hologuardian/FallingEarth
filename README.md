FallingEarth
============

Mod made by Hologiardian for the MCP modjam.

Explosions and DivineRPG levels of difficulty! <3

Small meteors will spawn at night for the first three days, mobs will spawn around them and the player 
must fight them to mine the center spawner blocks. These blocks drop meteoritic essence which is used to 
craft tools and armor.

After 3 days larger meteors will start spawning, they don't give extra loot bug create bigger explosions. :D
